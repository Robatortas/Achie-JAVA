	Writing a lot of documentation comments
	and giving the classes some structure.
	
	
	I will probably need to implement a binary tree to be able
	to sort all the contents inside a KeyChain, to make it hierarchical (I ALSO MAKE SPELLING MISTAKES LIKE ANY OTHER HUMAN!),
	so that will be a little pain, but no worries!
	
	Keys are incredibly easy to implement really, I already have them done!
	The big problem is the KeyChains!!! fawwwkkk.
	
	if two keys are in one line, it will separate them to be each in a different line!
	so after a semicolon, it will put everything else after it in another line. (SMART!)

	Thinking about how the keys will be read in achie.
	
	Soo.... The easiest way to do so would be the following:
	
	- Since keys are just one line of code each.
