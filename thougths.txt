	Writing a lot of documentation comments
	and giving the classes some structure.
	
	
	I will probably need to implement a binary tree to be able
	to sort all the contents inside a KeyChain, to make it hierarchical (I ALSO MAKE SPELLING MISTAKES LIKE ANY OTHER HUMAN!),
	so that will be a little pain, but no worries!
	
	Keys are incredibly easy to implement really, I already have them done!
	The big problem is the KeyChains!!! fawwwkkk.
	
	if two keys are in one line, it will separate them to be each in a different line!
	so after a semicolon, it will put everything else after it in another line. (SMART!)
