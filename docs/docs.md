# VARIABLES

Achie enables the use of making variables and storing data inside them.

There are two types of variables, the single-data variables and the multi-data variables.

### Single-Data Variables:
They can store one type of data, like strings, characters, booleans, and any type of number (int, float, short, etc).

### Multi-Data Variables:
They can store one or more variables inside them.
