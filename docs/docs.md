  This is the docs page, where you can learn all about Achie's syntax.

  Here, you will learn how Achie's syntax works, and how you can use it to store data with ease.
  
  
  (Achie is still in early stages of development, and is maintained by one guy, so please understand the slow progress!)

## VARIABLES

Achie enables the use of making variables and storing data inside them.

There are two types of variables, keys and keychains.

### Keys:
They can store one type of data, like strings, characters, booleans, and any type of number (int, float, short, etc).

### KeyChains:
They can store one or more variables inside them.
